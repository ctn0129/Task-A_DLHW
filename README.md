# Dynamic CNN with Channel Selection

This repository implements a Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture designed to handle varying input channel combinations while maintaining a single model. The approach significantly improves efficiency compared to traditional methods that would require separate models for each channel combination.

## Overview

The Dynamic CNN uses a weight-generating mechanism to adapt to different input channel combinations (RGB, RG, RB, GB, R, G, B), making it versatile for scenarios where sensor data may be partially available. This project includes the model implementation, training pipeline, and comprehensive evaluation framework.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Convolution Module**: Adapts to varying input channels through dynamic weight generation
- **Channel Selection Support**: Single model handles all possible RGB channel combinations
- **Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) Integration**: Attention mechanism to enhance feature representation
- **Label Smoothing**: Implements label smoothing cross-entropy loss for better generalization
- **Ablation Studies**: Evaluates model performance with and without SE modules
- **Efficiency Analysis**: Compares parameter count with traditional approaches

## Model Architecture

The core components of the Dynamic CNN architecture include:

1. **ImprovedDynamicConvModule**: Generates convolutional weights based on input channel composition
   - Channel encoding network
   - Weight generation network
   - Optional Squeeze-and-Excitation attention

2. **ImprovedDynamicResidualBlock**: Bottleneck-style residual blocks using dynamic convolutions
   - Three dynamic convolution layers
   - Shortcut connections

3. **DynamicCNN**: Main model composed of initial convolution, residual blocks, and classifier
   - Configurable depth and width
   - Adaptive global pooling
   - Fully connected classifier layer

## Dataset

The model is designed to work with the Mini-ImageNet dataset with support for:
- Multiple channel combinations (RGB, RG, RB, GB, R, G, B)
- Data augmentation techniques:
  - Random crops
  - Horizontal flips
  - Rotation
  - Color jitter
  - Random erasing

## Training

The training process includes:

## Evaluation

Comprehensive evaluation is performed through:

1. **Channel Combination Testing**: Model performance across all 7 possible channel combinations
2. **SE Module Ablation**: Comparative analysis with and without the Squeeze-and-Excitation mechanism
3. **Model Efficiency**: Comparison with traditional approaches requiring separate models
